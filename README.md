# Welcome

This project is a simple example of how to work with [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container.

All you need to have installed on your system to run this example is [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

If you do not have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your development system, you can download and install the freely available [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
